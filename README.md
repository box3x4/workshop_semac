# workshop_semac
Workshop I gave at SEMAC 2016

The workshop had the objective to introduce MongoDB to its participants so they could kickstart their side-projects. I also talked about big data and general NoSQL concepts.

It was scheduled a example demonstration, but we didn't have time to start the application. We were supposed to create a simple CRUD system using the concepts learnt in the workshop. The source code is available here. PS.: I'm sorry for my attempt at React, I tried to challenge myself by learning something new. It was not part of the workshop, so I didn't show the view code.
